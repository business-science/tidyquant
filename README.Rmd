# Features of Tidyquant

### Bringing Excel to R in tidyquant 1.0.0

>NEW: Tidyquant 1.0.0 is the _"R for Excel Users"_ release. My aim is to build functionality that helps users coming from an __Excel Background__ (background I came from). It's important to have these users feel at home. I have a full suite of functionality to accomplish your Excel-to-R transition.

>-Matt

Details on the __Excel integrations__ are covered in the blog article, [_"Excel in R - Pivot Tables, VLOOKUPs, and more"_](https://www.business-science.io/finance/2020/02/26/r-for-excel-users.html).



### Bringing Financial Analysis to the tidyverse

`tidyquant` integrates the best resources for collecting and analyzing financial data, `zoo`, `xts`, `quantmod`, `TTR`, and `PerformanceAnalytics`, with the tidy data infrastructure of the `tidyverse` allowing for seamless interaction between each. You can now perform complete financial analyses in the `tidyverse`.

## Benefits

* __A few core functions with a lot of power__
* __Integrates the quantitative analysis functionality of `zoo`, `xts`, `quantmod`, `TTR`, and _now_ `PerformanceAnalytics`__
* __Designed for modeling and scaling analyses using the the `tidyverse` tools in [_R for Data Science_](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)__
* __Implements `ggplot2` functionality for beautiful and meaningful financial visualizations__
* __User-friendly documentation to get you up to speed quickly!__

## One-Stop Shop for Serious Financial Analysis

With `tidyquant` all the benefits add up to one thing: _a one-stop shop for serious financial analysis!_


### Core Functions

* __Getting Financial Data from the web: `tq_get()`__. This is a one-stop shop for getting web-based financial data in a "tidy" data frame format. Get data for daily stock prices (historical), key statistics (real-time), key ratios (historical), financial statements, dividends, splits, economic data from the FRED, FOREX rates from Oanda.  

* __Manipulating Financial Data: `tq_transmute()` and `tq_mutate()`__. Integration for many financial functions from `xts`, `zoo`, `quantmod`,`TTR` and `PerformanceAnalytics` packages. `tq_mutate()` is used to add a column to the data frame, and `tq_transmute()` is used to return a new data frame which is necessary for periodicity changes.  

* __Performance Analysis and Portfolio Analysis: `tq_performance()` and `tq_portfolio()`__. The newest additions to the `tidyquant` family integrate `PerformanceAnalytics` functions. `tq_performance()` converts investment returns into performance metrics. `tq_portfolio()` aggregates a group (or multiple groups) of asset returns into one or more portfolios. 

### Comparing Stock Prices

Visualizing the stock price volatility of four stocks side-by-side is quick and easy...

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/sample_img_1_volatility.png")
```


### Evaluating Stock Performance

What about stock performance? Quickly visualize how a $10,000 investment in various stocks would perform.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/sample_img_2_stock_returns.png")
```

### Evaluating Portfolio Performance

Ok, stocks are too easy. What about portfolios? With the `PerformanceAnalytics` integration, visualizing blended portfolios are easy too!

* Portfolio 1: 50% FB, 25% AMZN, 25% NFLX, 0% GOOG
* Portfolio 2: 0% FB, 50% AMZN, 25% NFLX, 25% GOOG
* Portfolio 3: 25% FB, 0% AMZN, 50% NFLX, 25% GOOG
* Portfolio 4: 25% FB, 25% AMZN, 0% NFLX, 50% GOOG

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/sample_img_3_portfolio_returns.png")
```

This just scratches the surface of `tidyquant`. Here's how to install to get started.

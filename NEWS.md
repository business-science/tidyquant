## tidyquant 0.5.1

* Improvements
    * Added `pkgdown` integration.
    * `tq_get()` where `get = "key.ratios"` now permits specifying a specific exchange - e.g. "EPA:UBI". This enables fetching basic non-US company financials. In the event finances aren't in USD, ratios involving stock price - e.g. "Price to Earnings" - will no be calculated.

* Fixes:
    * Require new `quantmod` version 0.4-8 to fix Oanda and Yahoo bugs.
    * Quandl data returned newest to oldest. For consistency with other `tq_get()` data, it now returns oldest to newest.
    * Oanda only returns 180 days of FX and Metals data now. Updated the tests to account for this. Also added error handling to check for valid date ranges.
    * Fixed bug with `tq_portfolio()` where `weights = NULL` would not execute an equal weighting scheme.
    * Added error handling during dollar and percent conversion for get = "key.ratios" and get = "key.stats".

## tidyquant 0.5.0

* New Data:
    * Quandl Integration: 
        * `tq_get(get = "quandl")` is a wrapper for `Quandl::Quandl()` that pulls multiple Quandl Codes in a "tidy" fashion. 
        * `tq_get(get = "quandl.datatable")` is a wrapper for `Quandl::Quandl.datable()` that pulls Quandl datatables. 
        * `quandl_api_key()` is a wrapper for `Quandl::Quandl.api_key()`. 
        * `quandl_search` is a wrapper for `Quandl::Quandl.search()`.
    * Yahoo Japan Integration: `tq_get(get = "stock.prices.japan")` is a wrapper for `quantmod::getSymbols(src = "yahooj")` that enables getting stocks from Yahoo Finance Japan.
    
* Improvements and Fixes:
    * `tq_mutate()` and `tq_transmute()` now accept non-OHLC data through the `select` argument. They also now work with `rollapply`.
    * `tq_mutate()` and `tq_transmute()` now accept `PerformanceAnalytics` functions that work to clean and transform asset returns.
    * Deprecated the `ohlc_fun` argument to instead use `select` in `tq_mutate()` and `tq_transmute`
    * `.Deprecated` -> `.Defunct` for `tq_transform()` and `tq_transform_xy()`. Use `tq_transmute()` and `tq_transmute_xy()`. Move the sign post functions to deprecated.R
    * Remove the previously deprecated argument, `transform_fun` from `tq_transmute()`. Use `mutate_fun` instead.
    * Fix issue with `tq_mutate` returning rows incorrectly sorted
    * Fix issue with `tq_get` returning data frames as nested
    * Fix `tq_get` error to return full error when issues are present. 


## tidyquant 0.4.0

* New Features:
    * `tq_transmute()` replaces `tq_transform()` for consistency with `dplyr`.
    * `tq_performance()` which integrates the performance analysis functions of `PerformanceAnalytics`.
    * `tq_portfolio()` which enables aggregating portfolios from individual stock returns.
    * `tq_tranform()`: Added the NA-handling functions from `zoo` to the list of compatible, which provide a number of useful methods for handling `NA` values in data sets. Added `Return.calculate` and `Return.excess` for calculating returns and returns in excess of the risk-free rate, respectively.
* Documentation:
    * `tq_mutate()` and `tq_transmute()` help pages have been combined.
    * Split introduction into four separate vignettes, which improves flow and enables readers to more easily get to needed documentation. Now five docs total covering the primary needs of `tidyquant` users!
* New data:
    * `tq_exchange()` gets the stock list for NASDAQ, NYSE, and AMEX exchanges. Use `tq_exchange_options()` to exchange options.
    * `FANG` data set that can be loaded with `data(FANG)`.
* New visualizations that integrate with `ggplot2`:
    * `palette_()` functions used to create scales are exported.
    * `theme_tq()` creates light, dark, and green themes for tidyquant visualizations.
    * `scale_color_tq()` and `scale_fill_tq()` add color/fill scales for the data used in tidyquant visualizations.
* Improvements and Fixes:
    * The `transform_fun` argument of `tq_transmute()` has been replaced with `mutate_fun` for consistency with `tq_mutate()`.
    * Core functions are now generics to allow for extendability.
    * Issue #11: Part 2. Fix multiple stocks that only return 110 lines. Handle stocks that return csv with "We're sorry" message.
    * Issue #11: Part 1. Fix instability with `get = key.ratios` failing with HTTP 500 error on download. Use httr RETRY in case of failure.
    * Fixed issue with `get = "key.ratios"` where stocks listed on AMEX exchange were not able to return key ratios.
    * Issue #9: Fix problem with `get = "key.stats"` where NA's in multiple `x` (e.g. `c("AAPL", "GOOG")`) cause call to fail during coercion. 
    * Issue #8, Part 2: Enable compound gets (e.g. `tq_get("AAPL", get = c("stock.prices", "financials"))`).
    * Issue #8, Part 1: Create `tq_index()` function to return a stock index. `tq_get(get = "stock.index")` is deprecated and will be removed during the next version after 0.4.0. Use `tq_index_options()` for index options. 
    * Issue #7: Fixed issue with date column inadvertently being coerced to `dttm`. 

## tidyquant 0.3.0

* New data:
    * New `tq_get` option `get = "key.stats"`, which retrieves the current key statistics (55 total) from [www.finance.yahoo.com/](http://finance.yahoo.com/). These include various current data such as Ask, Bid, Day's High, Day's Low, Last Trade Price, current P/E Ratio, EPS, Current Market Cap, EPS Projected Current Year, EPS Projected Next Year and many more. Example: `tq_get("AAPL", get = "key.stats")`.
* New visualizations that integrate with `ggplot2`:
    * Chart geoms: Bar charts (`geom_barchart`) and candlestick charts (`geom_candlestick`) can be quickly created with the new geoms.
    * Moving Averages: Seven moving averages can be quickly visualized / prototyped using `geom_ma`. The geom wraps the `TTR::SMA` functions.
    * Bollinger bands can be visualized with `geom_bbands`. The same seven moving averages are compatible with the geom.
    * Zooming Into Chart Sections: Two functions (`coord_x_date` and `coord_x_datetime`) were added to enable zooming into chart sections using dates with no out-of-bounds data loss (e.g. out-of-bounds data loss with the `scale_x_` functions). 
* New Vignette: Covers "Charting with tidyquant".
* Fixes:
    * Issue #5: `tq_get` can now accept character vectors and data frames for the `x` arg, in addition to a single character input. This streamlines the getting of data for multiple inputs (e.g. stock symbols, stock indexes, etc).
    * Issue #4: Added `col_rename` arg to `tq_mutate` and `tq_transform`, which enables fast and easy renaming during the operation.
    * Issue #3: Integrated `dplyr::group_by()` with `tq_mutate()` and `tq_transform()`. The transform and mutate functions now work properly with grouped data frames.
    * Issue #2: Fixed bug with `tq_get()`, `get = "key.ratios"`, where key ratios for stocks from the NYSE returned `NA`.
* Removed support for deprecated arguments: `x_fun`, `.x`, and `.y` in the respective transform and mutate functions.

## tidyquant 0.2.0

* New `get = "key.ratios"` option for `tq_get()`, which retrieves 10-years of key performance ratios (89 total) from [www.morningstar.com](https://www.morningstar.com). These include various historical measures of financial performance including profitability, growth, cash flow, financial health, efficiency, and valuation ratios. Example: `tq_get("AAPL", get = "key.ratios")`.
* Added `zoo` `rollapply()` functions to list of compatible / integrated functions used with `tq_transform()` and `tq_mutate()`. See `tq_transform_fun_options()` for the full list.
* Changed `tq_mutate()`, `tq_transform()`, `tq_mutate_xy()` and `tq_transform_xy()` arguments to be more obvious:
    * `x_fun` is now `ohlc_fun` for `tq_mutate()` and `tq_transform()`
    * `.x` is now `x` and `.y` is now `y` for `tq_mutate_xy()` and `tq_transform_xy()`
* Fixed duplication of column names during `tq_mutate`. Names are now sequentually indexed with duplicate names starting at `.1` suffix.  


## tidyquant 0.1.0 

* Initial release of `tidyquant`, for seamless quantitative financial analysis (`xts`, `quantmod`, `TTR`) package integration with the `tidyverse`.
